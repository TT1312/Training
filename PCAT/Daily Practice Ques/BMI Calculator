BMI Calculator:

Create a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator program. The program should ask the user for their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters). Then, 
calculate the BMI using the formula BMI = weight / (height * height). Finally, classify the BMI into categories according to the following criteria:
Underweight: BMI < 18.5
Normal weight: 18.5 <= BMI < 25
Overweight: 25 <= BMI < 30
Obese: BMI >= 30
 

start 
declear BMI
print "enter weight in kg"
input weight
print "enter height in meters"
input height
BMI = weight / (height * height)
 if (BMI < 18.5)  print "Underweight"
else if (BMI < 25 && BMI >= 18.5)  print "Normal weight"
else if (BMI < 30 && BMI >= 25)  print "Overweight"
else print "obese"
end
