//Ticket Pricing:

You are designing a ticket pricing program for a movie theater. The program should prompt the user for their age and the type of movie they want to watch (e.g., "regular" or "3D"). 
Based on the age and movie type, the program should calculate and output the ticket price according to the following rules:
Regular Movie:
Age < 18: $8
Age >= 18: $12
3D Movie:
Age < 18: $10
Age >= 18: $15



start 
print enter age
input age
print enter type of movie e.g reguler or 3D
switch(movieType)
case "regular":
	if age < 18   print "price of ticket is" + $8
        else  print "price of ticket is" + $12
        break
case "3D":
        if age < 18 print  "price of ticket is" + $10
        else print "price of ticket is" + $15
        break
default: "enter movieType"
end
