Day of the Week:

		Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number between 1 and 7 representing a day of the week (1 for Sunday, 2 for Monday, and so on). Use a switch statement 
to determine the day entered by the user and output the corresponding day name. If the user enters a number outside the range of 1-7, display an error message.
