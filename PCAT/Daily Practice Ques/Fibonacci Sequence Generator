// Fibonacci Sequence Generator:

		Write a program to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the 
sum of the two preceding numbers (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...). Prompt the user to enter the number of terms they want to generate and use a loop to calculate and output the sequence.



 start
declear nextnum
print "enter number"
input number
first=0
second=1
print first + "," + second
for(int i =2; i<= number; i++)
nextnum=first+second
print nextnum
first=second
second=nextnum
end
