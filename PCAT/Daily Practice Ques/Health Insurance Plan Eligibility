//Health Insurance Plan Eligibility:

Design a program that determines whether a person is eligible for a particular health insurance plan based on the following criteria:
Age must be between 18 and 65.
Must not have any pre-existing medical conditions.
Must not have any recent hospitalizations (within the last 6 months).
Prompt the user to input their age, medical condition status, and hospitalization status, then use complex logical expressions to determine and output whether
they are eligible for the insurance plan.



start
print "enter age"
input age
print "have any pre-existing medical conditions (yes/no)"
input medical_conditions
print "have any recent hospitalizations within the last 6 months (yes/no)"
input hospitalizations_status

if (18 <= age <= 65 &&  medical_conditions.equal"no" && hospitalizations_status.equals("no"))
    print "you are eligible for Health Insurance Plan"
else  print "you are not eligible for Health Insurance Plan"
end
