Prime Number Generator:

		Create a program that generates and displays all prime numbers within a specified range (e.g., between 1 and 100). Use nested loops to iterate through each number in the range and determine if it's a prime number. 
A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
