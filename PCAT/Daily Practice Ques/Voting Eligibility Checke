//Voting Eligibility Checker:


   Create a program that determines whether a person is eligible to vote in an election based on the following criteria:
Age must be 18 or above.
Must be a citizen of the country.
Prompt the user to input their age, citizenship status (yes/no), and felony status (yes/no), and then use complex logical expressions to determine and output whether they are eligible to vote.

start
print "enter age"
input age
print "citizenship status: (yes/no)"
input citizenship_Status
print "felony status: (yes/no)"
input felony_Status
if (age >= 18 && citizenship_Status == "yes" &&  felony_Status == "yes")
    print "you are eligible for vote"
else print "you are not eligible for vote"
end
