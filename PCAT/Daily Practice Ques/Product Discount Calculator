 
//Product Discount Calculator:

Write a program that calculates the discount amount for a product based on the following criteria:
If the product price is over $100 and the customer is a premium member, they get a 20% discount.
If the product price is over $100 and the customer is not a premium member, they get a 10% discount.
If the product price is $100 or less, there is no discount.
Prompt the user to input the product price and their premium membership status, then use complex logical expressions to calculate and output the discount amount.
