Assignment 2: 
Recursive Function and Efficiency Analysis - Write a recursive function pseudocode and calculate the nth Fibonacci number and use Big O notation to analyze its efficiency.
Compare this with an iterative approach and discuss the pros and cons in terms of space and time complexit Fibonacci.

Recursive Approach:

Start
Print “enter num”
Input n
Call Fibonacci(n)
Print Fibonacci
Function Fibonacci(n)
      If n<=1
          return n
     else
             return Fibonacci(n-1)+ Fibonacci(n-2)
end



Iterative Approach:

start
declear nextnum
print "enter number"
input number
first=0
second=1
print first + "," + second
for(int i =2; i<= number; i++)
nextnum=first+second
print nextnum
first=second
second=nextnum
end




Recursive Approach: 
Pros: easy to understand and readability.
Cons: poor performance for large values of n, higher space complexity due to recursion 

Iterative Approach: 
Pros: better performance for large values of n
Cons: More complex implementation compared to the recursive approach.
