Assignment 3:
Create a document that describes the design of two modular functions: one that returns the factorial of a number, and another that calculates the nth Fibonacci number. 
Include pseudocode and a brief explanation of how modularity in programming helps with code reuse and organization.

Fibonacci number:

Start
Print “enter num”
Input n
Call fibonacci(n) 
Print fibonacci
function fibonacci(n) 
if n <= 1 
return n
 else 
return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2) 
end



Factorial Number:

start
declear n and fact
call factorial(n)
print factorial

function factorial(n)
if n < 1
return 1
else
n*factorial(n-1)
end




Benefits of modularity in programming:
1.Code reusability
2.Increase readability 
3.Easy to maintain code
4.Easy to add new functionality without affecting other parts of program
